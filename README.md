Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are small magnitude earthquakes, with typical magnitude less than 2, and reduced amplitudes at frequencies greater than 10 Hz relative to ordinary small earthquakes. Their occurrence is often associated with tectonic tremor and slow slip events along the plate boundary in subduction zones and occasionally transform fault zones. They are usually grouped into families of events, with all the earthquakes of a given family originating from the same small patch on the plate interface, and recurring more or less episodically in a bursty manner.   

During one of the research projects of my PhD, I have established two catalogs of LFEs for northern California. Both contains 66 families. The first one covers the period July 2007 to June 2009. The second one covers the period January 2004 to December 2011.   

The objective of this project is to visualize these catalogs in an interactive manner. We first group the earthquakes by time interval of occurrence. The user can choose to count the number of earthquakes per hour, per day, or per month. I use a slider to select the time interval to be plotted on the map. On the slider is also plotted the number of LFEs per time interval for a given LFE family.
